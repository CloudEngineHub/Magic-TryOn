        "describe": "The garment is a white T-shirt featuring a graphic design centered on the chest area. The design consists of four overlapping, lime green circles arranged in a cross-like pattern. Within this design, the words \"vivo Life\" are written in black, with \"FreshLife\" positioned below it, also in black. A thin horizontal line separates \"Life\" from \"FreshLife.\" The neckline of the T-shirt is a standard crew neck style, and there is a small, rectangular tag visible at the back of the collar, which appears to be a brand label. The overall style of the T-shirt is casual and modern."

Prominently displayed across the chest area is the word \"vivo\" in a bold, sans-serif font. The letters are colored in a gradient of blue shades, transitioning from a lighter to a darker hue. The fabric appears smooth and likely made of a cotton blend, suitable for casual wear. There are no visible patterns or additional graphics on the garment other than the \"vivo\" logo."
